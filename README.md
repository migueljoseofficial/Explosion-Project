# Explosion-Project
My final project for Fundamentals of Computing!

Using the arrow keys, you can play 'Explosion!'. Based off of agar.io, this terminal-based game has the player collect as many points as possible while avoiding harmful red squares. However, the more points you get, the bigger target you become... literally. 

This project leverages the gfx graphics library for the C programming language.
